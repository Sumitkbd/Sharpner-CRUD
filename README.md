Explanation:
Create (C):

A new task is added to the todos array with a unique id and content.
createTodo() handles this operation.
Read (R):

The displayTodos() function is used to show all tasks stored in the todos array.
Update (U):

The editTodo() function allows users to update a task. It finds the task by id, prompts the user to edit the content, and updates the task.
Delete (D):

The deleteTodo() function removes a task from the todos array by id.
Clear All:

The removeAll() function clears the entire list.
This setup ensures all CRUD operations are efficiently handled for your TO-DO list application.
